                    <p>Iâ€™m Rayhan Rusyd, a Front End web developer. Right now Iâ€™am a student in Faculty of Industrial Engineering at Bandung Institute of Technology since 2022. I also love to work on some of my personal project to test my skills.</p>
                    <p>Some of my Front End skills are related to my experience on using ReactJS and Next.js, while sometimes also learning a slight of Django.Py as the back-end framework. Not only on web development, but I also love to work on a small python related project such as creating a Discord bot.</p>
